And I need to add telegram solana_top_developer, email chris.dav.warren@gmail.com email buttons. update the readme.md file

To update the `README.md` file, I will:
1. Replace all instances of the GitHub username `outsmartchad` with `chirsdav`.
2. Add Telegram (`solana_top_developer`) and email (`chris.dav.warren@gmail.com`) contact buttons.

Hereâ€™s the updated section of the `README.md` file with the changes:

### Telegram: [solana_top_developer](https://t.me/solana_top_developer)
