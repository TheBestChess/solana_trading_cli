# Solana Trading CLI
A simple, fast, powerful Library for building custom trading strategies on Solana. It's built for speed, variety, and real-time data, using Cutting-edge Tech. Here's what you get:

- Uses low-latency systems like Jito, BloXroute, and Nozomi to execute trades,

- Read/write Pumpfun data in a local postgreSQL db.

- Supports DEXs like Raydium, Orca, Meteora, and Pump.fun for more trading options.

- Streams transactions and/or accounts state from a third-party's geyser gRPC node.

- Fetches account state info via optimized RPC methods.

This bot fits into your trading system, perfect for newbies.

# Core Components

## Token Creation and Multi-DEX Support
Create your own Solana SPL tokens on mainnet via Pump.fun and swap tokens across multiple decentralized exchanges:

| Exchange | Documentation |
|----------|---------------|
| Jupiter  | [CLI & trading functions guide](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/blob/typescript-main/src/jupiter/README.md) |
| Raydium   | [CLI & trading functions guide](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/blob/typescript-main/src/raydium/README.md) |
| Orca      | [CLI & trading functions guide](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/blob/typescript-main/src/orca/README.md) |
| Meteora   | [CLI & trading functions guide](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/blob/typescript-main/src/meteora/README.md) |
| Pump.fun  | Integrated support |


## Local Database Setup (In Development)

The project includes a PostgreSQL database for storing Pump.fun trading data and market analysis. For detailed setup instructions, see [Database Documentation](docker_postgres_db/README.md).

Quick setup:
```bash
# Navigate to database directory
cd docker_postgres_db

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start database
docker-compose up -d
```


## Low-Latency Infrastructure
Accelerate transaction finality using Jito and bloXroute for lightning-fast trades. Both capable of pushing your trasaction faster then any other service provider on the market

| Provider | Description |
|----------|---------------|
| Jito      | Fast trascation and optimizes transaction ordering and execution specifically |
| Bloxroute | Fast trascation and accelerates transaction propagation |
| Nozomi    | Optimzed tx submission to current blockleader |


The database stores:
- Trading history and limit orders
- Token tracking and pool migrations
- Market analysis and transaction data


## Open-Source Geyser gRPC Bots
Leverage our cutting-edge, open-source gRPC trading bots:

| Bot Name | Features | Source |
|----------|----------|--------|
| gRPC Pump.fun Sniper Bot | Ultra-low latency (0.4-2 seconds) | [View source](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/tree/typescript-main/src/grpc_streaming_dev/grpc-pf-sniper) |
| gRPC Copy Bot | Replicate successful trading strategies | [View source](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/tree/typescript-main/src/grpc_streaming_dev/grpc-copy-bot) |

## Real-Time Market Data
Fetch critical metrics for any liquidity pool in real-time with RPC calls:
- Price
- LP-burn percentage
- Pool reserve
- Market cap

Our comprehensive toolkit provides everything you need to create your own custom trading bot, tailored to your unique strategies and requirements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd solana-trading-cli
   ```

3. **Install the correct Node.js version**
   ```bash
   nvm install
   nvm use
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the test script**
   ```bash
   ts-node test.ts
   ```

### Installation Prerequisites

- [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version specified in `.nvmrc`)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, please check our [FAQ](link-to-faq) or [open an issue](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/issues).

## üö® Set Up 

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps:

### 1. Environment Configuration

1. Locate the template file:
   ```
   src/helpers/.env.example
   ```

2. Copy this file and rename it to `.env` in the same directory.

3. Open the `.env` file and add the following required information:
   - Mainnet wallet secret key (required)
   - RPC endpoint (required)
   - Custom Jito fee (if needed)

4. Optional configurations:
   - Devnet wallet secret key
   - Helius RPC url + key (e.g. getting latest price from dexes)
   - Shyft geyser gRPC token (for grpc trading bots development) (Link to Shyft: https://shyft.to/)

### 2. API Keys and Wallet Setup

- **Solana Wallet**: Ensure you have a funded Solana mainnet wallet. The secret key is required for mainnet transactions.
- **RPC Endpoint**: Obtain a RPC endpoint from reliable node operator like Helius to connect to Solana
- **Jito Integration**: If uses Jito, prepare your custom fee configuration.
- **Shyft Geyser gRPC** (Optional): If you are developing algo trading bot, buy a grpc token from reliable operator like Shyft.

### 3. Final Check

- Confirm that your `.env` file is properly configured and saved.
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the correct location: `src/helpers/.env`
- Verify that you haven't accidentally committed your `.env` file to version control.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: Never share or commit your `.env` file or any private keys. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` for your safety.

For any issues with configuration, please refer to our [Troubleshooting Guide](link-to-troubleshooting) or [open an issue](https://github.com/chirsdav/solana-trading-cli/issues).

## ü§ñ Plans

- A local-based db to store your limit orders ‚úÖ

- Smart scripts to help you detect potential rug pulls on pump.fun, e.g. dev sold, master wallet, similar past rug patterns

- More gRPC bots to come ‚úÖ

- More algos to trade on raydium/Pump.fun

- Make it more easier to install, deploy the bot using docker ‚úÖ

## ü™ô Final State of this repo

- Best trading framework on Solana

- Best package/library for trading development on solana, e.g.(we could make it easy to like Raydium.buy("token", 0.01sol, 1%slippage))

- Best open-soured trading bot

- Succeed with Solana dev!
